This repository includes my notes of the Deep Learning Lectures of DeepMind and UCL. 

The lectures can be found here: https://youtu.be/7R52wiUgxZI

There are 12 videos focused on deep learning as the name suggests. There is a separate markdown file for each lecture. 

**To Do:**

* Turkish translation (Any help would be appreciated.)

**For questions:**

Shoot me an e-mail. 

If you like the notes, let me know. I may consider creating a nice pdf documentation with more visualization.

Stay safe and healthy.
